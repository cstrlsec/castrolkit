# castrolkit
🛠️ Collection of mini scripts for recon + diagnostics
----
## 🛠️ What is this?

Castrolkit is a collection of small scripts designed for network reconnaissance and system diagnostics. It's a quick toolkit for gathering information and troubleshooting issues.

## 🚧 Status
This repository is under active development. I'm continuously adding and refining scripts to expand its capabilities. Expect ongoing updates and improvements.

## 📚 What I'm Learning
- deepening network reconnaissance techniques: exploring advanced methods for network mapping, open port scanning, and service identification.
- system health monitoring: developing scripts to diagnose performance bottlenecks, resource usage, and common system issues.
- error handling and robustness: improving script reliability and user experience through better error management.
